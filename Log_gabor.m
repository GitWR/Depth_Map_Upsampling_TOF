% GABORCONVOLVE - function for convolving image with log-Gabor filters
%
% Usage: EO = Log_gabor(im,  nscale, norient, minWaveLength, mult, ...
%			    sigmaOnf, dThetaOnSigma, feedback)
%
% Arguments:
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate 
% to the specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  
%
%   Variable       Suggested   Description
%   name           value
%  ----------------------------------------------------------
%    im                        Image to be convolved.
%    nscale          = 4;      Number of wavelet scales.
%    norient         = 6;      Number of filter orientations.
%    minWaveLength   = 3;      Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult            = 2;      Scaling factor between successivefilters.连续滤波器之间的比例因子
%    sigmaOnf        = 0.65;   Ratio of the standard deviation of the
%                              Gaussian describing the log Gabor filter's
%                              transfer function in the frequency domain
%                              to the filter center frequency. 
%    dThetaOnSigma   = 1.5;    Ratio of angular interval between filter
%                              orientations and the standard deviation of
%                              the angular Gaussian function used to
%                              construct filters in the freq. plane.
%    feedback         0/1      Optional parameter.  If set to 1 a message
%                              indicating which orientation is being
%                              processed is printed on the screen.
%
% Returns:
%
%   EO a 2D cell array of complex valued convolution results
%
%        EO{s,o} = convolution result for scale s and orientation o.
%        The real part is the result of convolving with the even
%        symmetric filter, the imaginary part is the result from
%        convolution with the odd symmetric filter.
%
%        Hence:
%        abs(EO{s,o}) returns the magnitude of the convolution over the
%                     image at scale s and orientation o.
%        angle(EO{s,o}) returns the phase angles.
%   
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% dthetaOnSigma 1.5
% sigmaOnf  .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf  .75   mult 1.6     (bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf  .65   mult 2.1
% sigmaOnf  .55   mult 3       (bandwidth ~2 octaves)
%                                                       
% For maximum speed the input image should be square and have a 
% size that is a power of 2, but the code will operate on images
% of arbitrary size.  
%
%
% The determination of mult given sigmaOnf is entirely empirical
% What I do is plot out the sum of the filters in the frequency domain
% and see how even the coverage of the spectrum is.
% If there are concentric 'gaps' in the spectrum one needs to
% reduce mult and/or reduce sigmaOnf (which increases filter bandwidth)
%
% If there are 'gaps' radiating outwards then one needs to reduce
% dthetaOnSigma (increasing angular bandwidth of the filters)
