# Depth_Map_Upsampling_TOF
This is a matlab implementation of J.Park's work "High Quality Depth Map Upsampling for 3D-TOF Cameras" . 
We test our implementation with a TOF-Simulated.mat file, and our results is close to the original authors.
Here, I want to show my deeply thanks to my friend Gong-Zhe Su(graduate from Tsinghua University).
